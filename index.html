                <p>The Poly Hanoi Project focuses on the integration of advanced robotics 
                with human workforces to create seamless and efficient collaboration between 
                humans and robots. Our project aims to enhance productivity and safety in various 
                industries by leveraging the strengths of both human intelligence and robotic precision.</p>
                <p>Our team at Cal Poly SLO is dedicated to researching and developing innovative solutions 
                that facilitate smooth interaction between humans and robots. By studying the dynamics of human-robot collaboration, we aim to create systems that are intuitive, adaptable, and capable of working in harmony with human counterparts.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Our project is currently at a stage where we are looking to expand
                         our collaborations and invite partnerships from industries interested in pioneering human-robot 
                         collaboration. We believe that the future of work lies in the symbiotic relationship between humans 
                         and robots, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this transformation.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>We are committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in human-robot interaction 
                    and are constantly exploring new ways to make our systems more efficient and user-friendly.</p>

                    <p>Some might call it cheating, but we're engineers so we call it using our head. Specifically we will use 
                        our head with an EEG headset, which detects brain waves, and use code to relay those instructions to 
                        a robot arm to solve the puzzle.

                    <p>The Emotiv headset captures real-time data from the user and transmits it to a computer via USB.
                         A Java server on the computer relays this data to a Python client on a Raspberry Pi installed in the cobot, which then acts on this information. 
                         By using a blend of software and hardware we link all of these steps within a local host, however in the future we plan on using a centralized network such as AWS to improve data retrieval and commands.

                    </h3>
                    <p>This project represents the initial phase in developing a new method for Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). A collaborative robot (cobot) is designed to work alongside a human to complete a common task. By recognizing and responding to human emotional and cognitive states, 
                        cobots could improve productivity, reduce stress, and enhance safety in the workplace. In the future, 
                        this project could significantly impact daily routines, jobs, and various industries by enabling cobots to assist in tasks ranging from household chores to complex industrial processes.
